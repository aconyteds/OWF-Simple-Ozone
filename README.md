# OWF-Simple-Ozone
Simple Ozone Implementation which will use Dojo.

This is designed to be a simple out of the box solution which enables a developer to quickly stand up an dojo-ready application for use with the Ozone Widget Framework. Included with this repo is dojo 1.10.4 (Pulled 7/24/15) which should enable a developer to build their codebase.

## Integrating with OWF
1. Deploy the application to a web searver which is reachable by your Ozone deployment.
2. Login to your Ozone deployment as an administrator.
3. Navigate to App Components (Or equivalent in your environment for where you add apps to Ozone).
4. Click create at the bottom, input the descriptor.html URL in the box, select Load.
5. Make changes as necessary to fit your environment, once done reload OWF to make it available to the current user.

If these instructions do not work, please see the [OWF git-hub repository](https://github.com/ozoneplatform/owf-omp-docs) for documentation on OWF and a more detailed installation guide.
